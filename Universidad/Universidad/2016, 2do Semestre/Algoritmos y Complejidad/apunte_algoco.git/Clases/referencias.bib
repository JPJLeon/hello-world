  abstract =	 {A randomized strategy for maintaining balance in
		  dynamically changing search trees that has optimal
		  expected behavior is presented. In particular, in
		  the expected case an update takes logarithmic time
		  and requires fewer than two rotations. Moreover, the
		  update time remains logarithmic, even if the cost of
		  a rotation is taken to be proportional to the size
		  of the rotated subtree. The approach generalizes
		  naturally to weighted trees, where the expected time
		  bounds for accesses and updates again match the
		  worst case time bounds of the best deterministic
		  methods. The balancing strategy and algorithms are
		  exceedingly simple and should be fast in practice},
